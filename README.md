# CLASSIFIER

A simple program made for a course called "Modeling and Computation Algorithms". It's purpose is classifying samples of numerous natures, based on the data presented in a dataset (which must be a CSV file of integers, where all but the last digits refer do a given aspect of that which we want to classify).

The first App (AppOneClass) creates a Bayesian Network based on the data provided by the CSV file (such as bcancer.csv), based on probability theories further explained on the project statement. 
The second app takes a sample which has yet do be classified and then it goes on to classify it.
